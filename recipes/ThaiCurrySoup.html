    <h1>Red Thai Curry Soup</h1>
    
    <img src="../images/Soup.webp" alt = 'ThaiCurrySoup'width = '500' length = '500'> 

    <p><h2>The Soup:</h2></p>
    <p>Thai red curry soup calls for jasmine rice instead of rice noodles. We puree the soup before adding onions and herbs for a smooth, rich texture. Adding a squeeze of lemon juice<br> at the end brightens up this traditionally-flavored soup. Serve this as a light dinner entree, or pair it with another protein or vegetable side for a heartier meal.</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided </li>
